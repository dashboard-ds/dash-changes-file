Smart agriculture is being implemented to minimise farmers' time consumption while also being cost effective. Predicting vast amounts of data is tough, thus machine learning is being used to improve it. This approach is used to extract massive amounts of data. Since the world's population seems continually expanding, the food impact is increasing, resulting in a scarcity of food commodities. The regression kind of algorithms plays a vital role in diversification for sustaining high levels of production in agriculture. Smart agriculture is utilised to increase the nutritious value of food quality. For determining the complicated set of patterns type that does not exhibit the expected set of behaviour. Anomaly detection can also be used to categorise and detect the aberrant set of behaviour. This collection of procedures-is used to monitor all data at the most recent level of approach, agricultural, and livestock regions.","1. Harvested crops were analysed employing image processing analysis where the Crop selection and crop quality are two elements that determine crop production rate.
2. To attain smart farming method, anomaly detection with autoencoders aids substantially in image compression, allowing it to analyse a greater number of features than some other unsupervised learning approaches
3. Machine learning can increase agricultural yield which estimate crop-based illnesses, irrigation patterns, and disease-based patterns.
4. Neural networks are used to categorise problems in classification and regression. Datasets make use of a sophisticated schema with hidden layers, which are represented by neural networks.
