Operation at low power allows lower volume and cost for the same current compared to only dissipative or non-dissipative current regulators. Further, the electrical energy storage device allows the power flowing through the current regulators to be varied independently in order to achieve the desired EIS perturbation current while a minimum amount of heat is generated in the circuit, thus allowing the circuit to occupy minimal size and incur minimal cost.",-,"JP2022141703A
